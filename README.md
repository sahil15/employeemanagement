# React-Employee-Management-App
Sample React  App for managing employee data (CRUD)


# Running the app

   To locally run the application,

   - Clone this repository.
   - To install depedencies in package.json, npm install.
   - Run react project using `npm start`.

# Few points
	- Create API was not working although i have added comments that should have been done.
	- Could have used Redux when it comes to big application.
	- Error Handling for popup could have done with form submission.
